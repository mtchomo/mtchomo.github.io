      <h2>I Won't Last a Day Without You</h2>
      <pre>
        <p>Day after day, I must face a world of strangers<br>Where I don't belong, I'm not that strong<br>It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to<br>Who will always care, you're always there</p>
        <p>When there's no gettin' over that rainbow<br>When my smallest of dreams won't come true<br>I can take all the madness the world has to give<br>But I won't last a day without you</p>
        <p>So many times when the city seems to be<br>Without a friendly face, a lonely place<br>It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you<br>And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile</p>
        <p>When there's no gettin' over that rainbow<br>When my smallest of dreams won't come true<br>I can take all the madness the world has to give<br>But I won't last a day without you</p>
        <p>Touch me and I end up singing<br>Trouble seems to up and disappear<br>You touch me with the love you're bringing<br>I can't really lose when you're near<br>When you're near, my love</p>
        <p>If all my friends have forgotten half their promises they're not unkind<br>Just hard to find<br>One look at you and I know<br>That I could learn to live without the rest<br>I've found the best</p>
        <p>When there's no gettin' over that rainbow<br>When my smallest of dreams won't come true<br>I can take all the madness the world has to give<br>But I won't last a day without you</p>
        <p>When there's no gettin' over that rainbow<br>When my smallest of dreams won't come true<br>I can take all the madness the world has to give<br>But I won't last a day without you</p>
